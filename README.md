# Card-Generator-2024-
Random Card Dealer in Javascript, HTML and CSS

In this project, you will learn how to change your website styles during the runtime using VanillaJS (plain normal js).

📝 Instructions
Create an algorithm that randomly builds a card on every refresh:

Every time the website refreshes a new random card needs to show.

The card must have one of the possible suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.

The card value must be one of the following: 2 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace, (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to this demo.
